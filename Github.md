# What I learned
I will only describe what I learned **new**. \
Except when I already know before reading `The Basics of GitHub` markdown file.

## Project board
I saw `Eternal return` shows how they will update game. \
It seems like developer version of that. 

## User Profile
I know this function in this assignment! \
It's like easter egg in Github and also very AWESOME!


# Still Confused

## Pull requests
I know about what is pull requests and how to use that function, but I want to see examples with that.
It could be hard to pull request in progress project I think.
So when I want to know how it works in detail, so I can get pull request easily.
